# Pipeline Installer Base
Pipeline Installer Base

This is the default implementation of a pipeline base image. It contains the absolute minimum dependencies needed to run pipelines in okteto as described in the [docs](https://www.okteto.com/docs/cloud/okteto-pipeline).

You can also [create your own](https://www.okteto.com/docs/reference/development-environment/#create-your-own)!
